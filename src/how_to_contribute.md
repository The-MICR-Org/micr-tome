>Don't get too caught up in ALL of the details of your idea whenever the moment of inspiration comes upon you. If you get too caught up in trying to make everything make sense immediately, you may not submit your idea at all. Remember, do your best and try to have some gawd damn fun.

For anyone who is new to contributing to open source and has a question about the relationship between ISSUES and PULL REQUESTS, Steve Donie answered on Quora:

**A pull request has code that fixes a bug or adds a feature. An issue in GitHub is just a description of a bug or a feature. A pull request might be created to address an issue, and merging the pull request might result in that issue being marked as ‚Äòresolved‚Äô.**

Before submitting a new **issue** be, sure to check the [Issues](https://github.com/Unearthlyglow/sveltego/issues) tab to see if the topic you are considering has already been brought up. 

Before submitting a new **pull request** be sure to check the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Unearthlyglow/sveltego/pulls) tab to check to see if anyone else is working on something you're thinking of contributing.

## Reporting Bugs <div align="right"> üêõ </div> 

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for  the MICR. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](https://github.com/Unearthlyglow/sveltego/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. 
**[!NEED]** Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

You can find a list of all the labels and their descriptions for this project [here](https://github.com/Unearthlyglow/micr-ccm/labels?sort=count-desc)
  
When creating an issue, please do your best to attach the appropriate labels. Don‚Äôt fret too much about making sure you‚Äôve attached the perfect set of labels to the issue, a maintainer will review each issue and then once it looks good will leave a comment either asking for more info or giving it the go-ahead to be worked, attach a GREEN label that says (Ready-To-Be-Worked) and list its priority and appropriate milestone association.

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain best practices across the many technologies involved with the project
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for MICR's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow the instructions in **[the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)**
2. Follow the **[styleguides](#styleguides)**
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all **[status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/)** are passing  What if the status checks are failing?f a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
