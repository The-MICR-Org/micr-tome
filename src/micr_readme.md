Hello, I hope you're well.

At this time a link to the web application has not been established because I need to work with my close community to establish a proper baseline for certain functions mainly around security(people's information) and authentication of instruments. 

If you have any immediate questions you would like to ask and can't find a resource on this repo to help you, feel free to send an email to Micr.Support@capsulescure.io. Response time is around 24-48 hours.

[Governance Document](./GOVERNANCE.md)

At this time since it‚Äôs just me(Award Malisi), I will be going with the ABDFL(Alleged-Benevolent Dictator For Life) for the time being. If people join up with me on this project, I‚Äôll definitely entertain the idea of a different leadership structure. I am more along the lines of someone who believes one should be skillful in leading and following.

## What is The MICR & Why was it created? <div align="right"> ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• </div>

<b><div align="right" >
[MICR Manifesto](./MICR_MANIFESTO.md)
</div></b>

### <ins> The What: </ins>
The MICR(Musical Instrument Compendium and Registry) is a digital compendium and registry for guitars and basses(at this time), that also acts as software to assist guitarists and bassists if their instrument is ever stolen or goes missing. 

&nbsp;

### <ins> The Why: </ins>
- A tool for the musical community that can help forestall the thievery of a musician‚Äôs instrument or at least aid a musician if such an event were to take place
- Once the project really get‚Äôs going I hope to fashion the project into a modular learning tool that can help software developers build and maintain an open-source full-stack application.
- And finally, a passion project is a good way to practice a majority of my skills within computer science as well as other disciplines such as writing and graphic design. I wish to build tools for the many communities in the world and I believe this project would be a nice preface to that idea.

[Project Roadmap](https://github.com/Unearthlyglow/micr-ccm/milestones)
</div></b>

You can follow the roadmap of the project by navigating to the ‚ÄòMilestones‚Äô page provided by Github, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Unearthlyglow/micr-ccm/milestones).

The current milestone is for version 0.5 of the project and is titled 'My Dedication', below is the goal of the milestone:

The goal of v0.5 is to set up the infrastructure and documentation for the project so that I can then invite a select few individuals who can scrutinize the project to help it be properly structured and healthy for any contributions from the greater public, a proper start is the only way to go about things.
