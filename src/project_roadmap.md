    -   [ ]  Check to see if a domain name has been taken: [https://instantdomains.com/search](https://instantdomains.com/search) I should figure out the branding and naming of the project soon so that I can reserve a domain.
    -   [ ]  Checking for trademark conflicts: [](https://branddb.wipo.int/en/quicksearch?sort=score%20desc&start=0&rows=30&asStructure=%7B%22boolean%22:%22AND%22,%22bricks%22:%5B%5D%7D&_=1706911720672)[https://branddb.wipo.int/en/quicksearch?sort=score](https://branddb.wipo.int/en/quicksearch?sort=score) desc&start=0&rows=30&asStructure={"boolean":"AND","bricks":[]}&_=1706911720672
